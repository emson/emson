#Halcyon Events logo on Jenson Button's Formula One helmet
Jenson Button has just got pole position ready for the Australian Formula One race tomorrow.  This is pretty exciting as on either side of his helmet is the [Halcyon Events Ltd. logo.](http://www.halcyonsport.com)

[Halcyon Events](http://www.halcyonsport.com) is a company that specialises in high end bespoke Formula One events.  Through their contacts they can take you and your clients behind the scenes to areas not normally permitted, and give you a unique experience into Formula One (F1).

The web site was built by me, the design was created by [Scamper Branding](http://www.scamperbranding.com/) and the logo on Jenson's helmet was designed by [Firefly Creative](http://www.fireflycreative.co.uk/).
