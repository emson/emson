This is just a quick note to apologise for not posting for the last couple of months.  A lot has been happening and I have actually written a number of posts but never quite finished them.  Also I promise to write more regularly come the end of March 2009 (hopefully).

Well my New Year started with a '[Looney Dook](http://www.theloonydook.co.uk/)' in the [Firth of Fourth](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=elie,+scotland&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=14.253717,33.925781&ie=UTF8&ll=56.193812,-2.82177&spn=0.052339,0.132523&z=13&iwloc=addr) on New Years day.  Man it was cold and a struggle to get in, but I felt fantastic afterwards.  Its seems like quite a good analogy of how my year has been so far.

Anyway I've been busy building a couple of web sites, with a number still under development, if you get a moment please check them out and let me know what you think:

 *  [www.halcyonsport.com](http://www.halcyonsport.com)
 *  [www.guygoodfellow.com](http://www.guygoodfellow.com)
 *  [www.ledudy.com](http://www.ledudy.com)

I've also been coming up with a number of little side line projects which I hope to share with you soon.  One of them involves using [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and if you want to hear more when the time comes you can follow me on [twitter/emson](http://www.twitter.com/emson).

Finally this year for me, and I'm sure everyone, seems to be about how to restructure and think in terms of business and income.  I expect if you are open to change and think a bit laterally there are many opportunities, if you don't change you are likely to struggle. 

The business world is changing beneath our feet and we need to be quick to act on the opportunities it presents us.  [Seth Godin's quick article](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/03/pivots-for-change-swords-and-plowshares.html) highlights this rather well.

So I'll start putting together some interesting articles from the beginning of April onwards - I hope you can wait till then, and thanks for following me.
