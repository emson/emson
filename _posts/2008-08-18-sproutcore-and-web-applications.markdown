#SproutCore and Web Applications
It's been a wee while since my last article, which has largely been due to my summer holiday.
Anyway I've been reading up and experimenting with the <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a> JavaScript framework.  

Its excellent but I wanted to explain why companies and developers should consider using it.  So I've written an article on my business partner's web site <a href="http://rapidappsgroup.com/content/desktop-web-applications-using-sproutcore/">http://rapidappsgroup.com/content/desktop-web-applications-using-sproutcore/</a>. <br/>

Please check it out as it tries to answer a lot of the general questions about web applications and JavaScript frameworks.

BE...
