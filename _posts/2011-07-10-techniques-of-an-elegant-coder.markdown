#Techniques of an Elegant Coder

##What is an Elegant Coder?
Writing code is an inherently tricky thing to do. It is a skill that you must constantly refine and inevitably you will look back at your previous work, and see flaws and mistakes, but how do you reduce these and strengthen your skill set?

I propose that you should strive to write elegant code.  So what is elegance?  [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/elegant) describes technical elegance as:

>  gracefully concise and simple; admirably succinct. 

It is code that is *graceful in form and refined in purpose*.  It is not bloated and complex, and should be easy on the eyes of the reader.  I like to think of coding as:

>  the procedure of describing a process with logic

Therefore to be an elegant coder you must **describe a process in an elegant and succinct way, using a programming language**.


[http://www.catonmat.net/blog/edsger-dijkstra-discipline-in-thought/](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/edsger-dijkstra-discipline-in-thought/)

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra described that a computer program should have the following characteristics: **Quality, correctness and elegance**.
He also has a daily disciplin of neatly writing down his thoughts and things that he has done.

  >  The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull, he therefore approaches his task in full humility and avoids clever tricks like the plague.

Don't solely rely on unit testing as 

  >  Program testing can convincingly show the presence of bugs but it is hopelessly inadequate to show their absence.


Also:

  >  Mathmatical elegance is not a question of esthetics, of taste or fashion, but something you can translate into a technical notaion.

The Oxford English dictionary defines elegance as:

  >  '...ingeniously simple and effective.'

  >  A program is managable if you make a truly elegant program.

  >  [a program should]... consist of discrete parts, each of which you can replace by an alternative implementation, without influencing the rest of the program.  Also curiously the most elegant programs are often the most efficient.

You have to create something that you can keep under your intellectual control, as in the early days the computer he was writing software for often didn't exist and could not be tested.

Why has elegance found so little following?
Elegance has the disadvantage, in that hard work is needed to achieve it and a good education to appreciate it.



##How to Become an Elegant Coder?

So how do you write code in an elegant and succinct way?  The most obvious answer is *practice* and practice a lot.  However its not just about practice, but also its about insight, style and disciplin.  These are skills that you can work on to develop elegance in your code.

Writing elegant code is not limited to one particular language, but certainly some languages are more elegant than others.  In this article I'm going to focus predominently on [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), however will recommend resources for other languages where appropriate.

These are my tips on how you can develop code elegance, if you disagree or want to suggest something I've missed please feel free to add a comment at the bottom:

##Practice... A Lot
You need to build up your knowledge in a programming language, not just the syntax and grammar but also the *how* and *why*.  For example **how** it functions under different conditions and **why** things work the way they do in that language.

Experiment and test your ideas.  This gives you a deeper understanding of what is happening under the covers.  For example write code that accesses an array with an invalid index, what happens, what errors are thrown, how do other languages respond to this type of problem.  This is a very trivial example but these are the sort of questions you should be asking in order to build up a deeper knowledge or your language.

One of the best ways to quickly to flex your coding skills is to try quizzes.  [Ruby Quiz](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FBest-Ruby-Quiz-Pragmatic-Programmers%2Fdp%2F0976694077%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1223046064%26sr%3D8-1&tag=emson-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738) is a great way to practice and refine your coding skills within a simple problem domain.  I would recommend [buying the book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FBest-Ruby-Quiz-Pragmatic-Programmers%2Fdp%2F0976694077%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1223046064%26sr%3D8-1&tag=emson-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738) as this will commit you to trying to solve them.  Once you have solved a problem, having the answers will really help in teaching you how to refine your code.


##Read OpenSource Code

Reading your own code is fine, since you know why you did certain things.  You know why you made choices and you understand your own style of writing code.

Reading other peoples code is harder, as you are having to step into the mind of that person as well as understanding their code.  Everybody makes strange choices maybe because they were under pressure, lazy or just not concentrating, it becomes your job to recognise these.

Look at OpenSource projects and look at the code.  This means not just viewing it, but really understanding it.
Rails projects to look at:

 *  [Inoshi](http://github.com/insoshi/insoshi/tree/master) - Social networking app for Rails.
 *  [Mephisto](http://github.com/technoweenie/mephisto/tree/master) - Rails blogging application.
 *  [RubyFlow](http://github.com/Sutto/rubyflow/tree/master) - Ruby news aggregation site.
 *  [Spree](http://github.com/schof/spree/tree/master) - ecommerce project used by RailsEnvy.

##Contribute to news groups
Sign up to news groups, and read the posts and actively try to contribute to the posts.

##Write a Blog
Research a topic and write a blog article about it.  This helps to solidify the knowledge in your mind.  If you allow comments the chances are that you will attract thoughts and ideas that you hadn't anticipated.

##A Modicum of Self Discipline
Being strict enough to set aside time to code, learn, read, and develop your skills.
Reduce your chances of procrastination, see GTD section.
Apps and tools: 
[WriteRoom](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom)


##Getting Things Done (GTD)
Learn how to create and prioritise your tasks each day.
Apps and tools:
[Things](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/)


##Read Widely Acclaimed Books
//Do some research into reading lists.
Books like:
[Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer)
[JavaScript: The good parts](http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222119003&sr=8-1)

##Build Your Own Tools
There are many circumstances when you have a choice to either develop own tools for a particular job or find a third party product that fits the bill.
If you find that the third party product doesn't quite fit in with what you want and its not too big a job, roll your own version.  Even better put yours up as an OpenSource project for others to use and review.

##Learn a New Language
Research and learn a new language.
Erlang and Scala are emerging as two very interesting languages, that will help you think about coding in a different way.
By learning a new language you change your mind, you will think in a different way.  You will acquire unexpected programming insights.

##Sharpen Your Editor Skills
Become a guru in a particular editor.  You will be programming day in day out, make sure that you know every shortcut and trick in the book for that editor.
Vim, Emacs, Textmate, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

##Develop a Philosophy 
You are not just programming for yourself, you are developing a legacy.  Your code could potentially out live you.  Take pride in it, anything you undertake should fit into your philosophy otherwise why waste your time.

##Non Profit Making Application
Build something for a charity or other non-profit making organisation.

##Style is Important
It adds consistency, can be used to prevent bugs as in languages like JavaScript (see Douglas Crockford).  Gives your code a sense of ownership.

##Deep Understanding of Problems
You will really need to understand a problem at a deep level.  No copying of code snippets unless you understand them.  This will allow you to then be creative in how you solve the problem.

##Mentor

##Agile Methodologies???
