<p>This is just a quick note to apologise for not posting for the last couple of months.  A lot has been happening and I have actually written a number of posts but never quite finished them.  Also I promise to write more regularly come the end of March 2009 (hopefully).</p>

<p>Well my New Year started with a '<a href="http://www.theloonydook.co.uk/">Looney Dook</a>' in the <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=elie,+scotland&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=14.253717,33.925781&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=56.193812,-2.82177&amp;spn=0.052339,0.132523&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=addr">Firth of Fourth</a> on New Years day.  Man it was cold and a struggle to get in, but I felt fantastic afterwards.  Its seems like quite a good analogy of how my year has been so far.</p>

<p>Anyway I've been busy building a couple of web sites, with a number still under development, if you get a moment please check them out and let me know what you think:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.guygoodfellow.com">www.guygoodfellow.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ledudy.com">www.ledudy.com</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I've also been coming up with a number of little side line projects which I hope to share with you soon.  One of them involves using <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and if you want to hear more when the time comes you can follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/emson">twitter/emson</a>.</p>

<p>Finally this year for me, and I'm sure everyone, seems to be about how to restructure and think in terms of business and income.  I expect if you are open to change and think a bit laterally there are many opportunities, if you don't change you are likely to struggle.</p>

<p>The business world is changing beneath our feet and we need to be quick to act on the opportunities it presents us.  <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/03/pivots-for-change-swords-and-plowshares.html">Seth Godin's quick article</a> highlights this rather well.</p>

<p>So I'll start putting together some interesting articles from the beginning of April onwards - I hope you can wait till then, and thanks for following me.</p>
